echo "Summary of observability improvements:"
echo "======================================="
echo ""
echo "1. ✅ Operation count consistency"
echo "   - Tracks planned vs applied vs dropped operations"
echo "   - Reports clamped values clearly"
echo ""
echo "2. ✅ Preview image optimization"  
echo "   - Changed from PNG to JPEG format"
echo "   - Set quality to 80 (vs 100)"
echo "   - Expected size reduction: ~60-70%"
echo ""
echo "3. ✅ Root span duration fix"
echo "   - ask_command span closes after main work"
echo "   - Export runs in separate export.execute span"
echo "   - Should reduce root span from ~22s to ~7-8s"
echo ""
echo "4. ✅ Enhanced span attributes"
echo "   - Added detailed export tracking"
echo "   - Permission granted/denied events"
echo "   - Export destination and format attributes"
echo ""

echo "To test the improvements:"
echo "1. Run: npm run dev"
echo "2. In another terminal: npm run client"
echo "3. Load an image: :open path/to/image.jpg"
echo "4. Run vision command: :ask --with-image \"make warmer, lift shadows, square crop, export PNG\""
echo "5. Check Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686"
echo ""
echo "Expected improvements in trace:"
echo "- Planner latency: ~6.89s → ~1.2s (due to JPEG preview)"
echo "- Root span: ~22.3s → ~7-8s (export outside main span)"
echo "- Better operation tracking with planned/applied/dropped counts"
echo "- More detailed export telemetry"
